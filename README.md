# 🌌 **Solar System 3D - Interactive Simulation** 🚀

A visually immersive 3D Solar System simulation where you can explore planets, control their revolution speeds, and interact with the environment in real-time. Developed using **React** and **Three.js**, this project lets you control planetary speeds, pause/resume simulations, and enjoy the beauty of our Solar System with realistic textures, moons, rings, and orbit paths.

## 📜 **Project Description**

Welcome to the **Solar System 3D Interactive Simulation**! This project allows you to explore the wonders of our solar system in a 3D environment. 

### **Features**
- 🌍 **Realistic Solar System Simulation**: Planets orbiting around the Sun based on real-world distances and revolution speeds.
- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls**: Adjust the revolution speed of each planet in real-time using sliders.
- ⏸️ **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Pause or resume the simulation at any time.
- 🌑 **Moons**: Earth has its Moon, and other planets (like Jupiter and Saturn) can be extended with additional moons.
- 💫 **Asteroid Belt**: Orbiting asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, making the experience even more dynamic.
- 🌞 **Glow Effect on the Sun**: A glowing sun that radiates light and warmth into the solar system.
- 🔭 **Orbit Paths**: See the clear orbital paths of the planets around the Sun.
- 🖱️ **Orbit Controls**: Navigate around the solar system and zoom in/out with ease using mouse controls.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **React**: For building the interactive UI and managing state.
- **Three.js**: For creating and rendering the 3D Solar System with realistic textures and lighting.
- **Vite**: Fast, modern build tool for development.
- **ESLint**: Code linting to maintain high code quality.
- **OrbitControls**: For smooth camera control in 3D space.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node package manager)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UjjwalTomar0808/solar-system-3d.git
   cd solar-system-3d
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start the Vite development server to run the project locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Once the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the Solar System in action!

4. **Building for Production:**

   To build the project for production, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The production build will be generated in the `dist` folder, ready to be deployed.
